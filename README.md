## Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Alexis, a Computer Science student at the University of California, Irvine.

I love learning new technologies, and try to constantly seek and overcome new challenges.

Things here are constantly under construction; I often work on my projects in private repositories for a while before setting them to public. Feel free to take a look around.

### Work Experience

**American Express** | *July 2020 - August 2020*

*Software Engineer Intern*

I worked with React, Redux, Jest, and Enzyme to develop reusable web modules with 100% unit test coverage. Part of my work involved communicating with another team on the best way to change their existing React component to be able to be used for various different needs.
