## Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Alexis, a Computer Science student at the University of California, Irvine.

I love learning new technologies, and try to constantly seek and overcome new challenges. The inspiration for my projects often comes from things I'd like to be able to use in my day to day life, from tracking statistics about my Instagram art account to having an easy way to manage and share lists and ideas with others. My goal is for other people to feel the same way and be able to make use of my projects in their lives as well!

I have a strong interest in backend development and data manipulation, and hope to work on something related to this in the future. I also enjoy UX design and data visualization, as I have a passion for art and all things visual.

### Work Experience

**Stripe** | *Software Engineer Intern* | *June 2021 - September 2021*

I worked with Ruby and Ruby on Rails to integrate a new Stripe feature in the Stripe Connector to NetSuite.

**American Express** | *Software Engineer Intern* | *July 2020 - August 2020*

I worked with React, Redux, Jest, and Enzyme to develop reusable web modules with 100% unit test coverage. Part of my work involved communicating with another team on the best way to change their existing React component to be able to be used for various different needs.
