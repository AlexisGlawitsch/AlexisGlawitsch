## Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Alexis, a Computer Science student at the University of California, Irvine.

I love learning new technologies, and try to constantly seek and overcome new challenges. The inspiration for my projects often comes from things I'd like to be able to use in my day to day life, from tracking statistics about my Instagram art account to having an easy way to manage and share lists and ideas with others. My goal is for other people to feel the same way and be able to make use of my projects in their lives as well!

I have a strong interest in backend development and data manipulation, and hope to work on something related to this in the future. I also enjoy UX design and data visualization, as I have a passion for art and all things visual.

Things here are constantly under construction; I often work on my projects in private repositories for a while before setting them to public. Feel free to take a look around.

### Repo Overview

**Creator Analytics** | *React.js, Spring Boot, SQLite* | *Ongoing*

My current side project at the moment. Intended to help Instagram Business and Creator accounts keep track of account statistics over longer periods of time than 7 days. The inspiration for this project came while I was attempting to graph out these statistics by hand â€” I realized there was no reason for me to do so when I could just write an application to do it for me! I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more about how full stack applications are linked together, as well as an introduction to working with databases on a small scale.

**Pixel Planner** | *React.js*

A very simple web application at the moment. It displays a grid of squares and allows you to change the color of each to your selected preference by clicking or clicking and dragging. Intended to be expanded into something a little more fleshed out, such as allowing the user to mark the grid with coordinates or adding a mode with 2D representations of Minecraft blocks rather than simple colors.

**GachaBot** | *Python*

A bot for the chat application Discord, written as a Python script. This is one of the first side projects I worked on, and taught me a lot about working with external libraries and APIs, parsing JSON data, simple image manipulation, and hosting via AWS.

### Work Experience

**Stripe** | *Software Engineer Intern* | *June 2021 - Present*

I'm working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails to improve the Stripe Connector to NetSuite.

**American Express** | *Software Engineer Intern* | *July 2020 - August 2020*

I worked with React, Redux, Jest, and Enzyme to develop reusable web modules with 100% unit test coverage. Part of my work involved communicating with another team on the best way to change their existing React component to be able to be used for various different needs.
