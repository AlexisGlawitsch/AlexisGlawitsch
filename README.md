## Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Alexis, a Computer Science student at the University of California, Irvine.

I love learning new technologies, and try to constantly seek and overcome new challenges. The inspiration for my projects often comes from things I'd like to be able to use in my day to day life, from tracking statistics about my Instagram art account to having an easy way to manage and share lists and ideas with others. My goal is for other people to feel the same way and be able to make use of my projects in their lives as well! 

Things here are constantly under construction; I often work on my projects in private repositories for a while before setting them to public. Feel free to take a look around.

### Work Experience

**American Express** | *Software Engineer Intern* | *July 2020 - August 2020*

I worked with React, Redux, Jest, and Enzyme to develop reusable web modules with 100% unit test coverage. Part of my work involved communicating with another team on the best way to change their existing React component to be able to be used for various different needs.
